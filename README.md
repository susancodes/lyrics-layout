Word cloud made up of lyrics from a song.

I wanted to visualize the word composition of songs to see if there are any patterns.

### <a name="output"></a>Sample Lyrics Word Clouds


#####Sample pop song:
There are a lot of big words, which means that there are a lot of repetitive words in the song.

#####Sample hip-hop song:
There are a lot of unique words. Some are big, but most are small, which means there are less repetitive lyrics in this song.
